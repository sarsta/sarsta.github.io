### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it incorporated a
    real-world situation into coding. I liked how the main goal was to find
    the prices of pizzas per square inch. This lab helped me tremendously with
    learning function definitions.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because of the way it combined
    math and computer science. I enjoyed writing code to calculate the area of
    a rectangle. I learned a lot about how to write functions.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was one of my favorite labs. I have always liked Mad Libs,
    and the idea of creating a sandwich Mad Lib was interesting to me. It was a
    great way to learn about command-line arguments and input validation, while
    also testing my creativity.
